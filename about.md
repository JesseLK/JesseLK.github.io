##About me

I am a developer, my job is protocol stack development. It runs on a chip which uses to make your device connect to the LTE network. So I will make some notes about the protcol which is published by the 3GPP. 

In addition, I will share some tools that i think is useful or cool, becase i really like to found some efficiently tools to make my daily work more easy and convient.

Most of the posts are about the Linux and the C Language. But I still interest in the front-end. Though i am not good at CSS3 and JavaScript, I still spare some time to learn them at my free time. 

I still interest in the composing, So i will share something about Latex and Markdown. Both of them can make more unimaginable things.
